# Head First Design Pattern using Go

Head First Design Pattern using idiomatic Go is my interpretation of the problems and solutions discussed in the book.

My interpretaions may be influenced by the explanation given in the book but not code. I would usually code 
my interpreation before reading any code samples given in the book for that respective problem ...

## Meaning of _My Interpretation_
- after reading the problem statement and sometimes the proposed _idea_ that later turns into a pattern according 
  to the book
- before reading the code snippets 
- before seeing the full blown class diagram of the solution in the book.
- Upon reading the pattern's formal definition and lingo, if nouns and lingo used in the code are too off, then I revise 
them but not the design. This usually happens in a separate commit. 

## Meaning of _Book Solution_
- after reading the complete chapter, convert/port the code into idiomatic Go
- if you are interested only to read the direct port of the book's solutions in Go, then directories ending with 
  `_booksolution` are the ones to go through
